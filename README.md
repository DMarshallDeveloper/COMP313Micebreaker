## Game Architecture
*Need information on how the level structure and game loop are set up here*
Micebreaker is a 2D puzzle [click to play] game that follows five core loops; Match cats in a given time frame, get a money total generated by points gained through successful matches, purchase items from the shop, decorate the speed cafe and then progress to the next level. 

Levels are time based, and the goal is to match as many cats as possible during the time allotted to playing. The cats also have patience timers, so there is a need to match them before they get fed up and leave. The score produced at the end of the level is based upon how many successful matches there were during the play
